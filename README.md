# Hello. World.
So the brief is to add some colour - some flavour - something new. Something new to a README file
which exists only to describe a repository in which you practice editing README files. It's so
deliciciously meta it immediately folds back on itself, and yet so immediately trivial it folds to
nothing.

So how do you do that. How do you add colour to something that folds to nothing?

The answer is to construct an opening which professes something greater than it really is. A kind 
of high-school philosophy consideration on existentialism. Dress it in a little mark-down to give 
it some technical chops and your done.

README enhanced. Achievement unlocked. 

And yet despite the banality of the task I leave with one clear sense: this environment really is
rather lovely to work in.
